# Traffic Sign Recognition System 🚦📷

This project implements a deep learning-based **Traffic Sign Recognition** system using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built with **Keras** and **TensorFlow**. It is trained on the **GTSRB (German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark)** dataset to accurately classify 43 different types of traffic signs.
